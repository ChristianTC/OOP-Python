# OOP-Python


Object Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm.

It consists in convert an object of real life to programming code.

An object have a state, a behavior and properties.

For example, a car(object) have:

- Properties (color, weight, mark, model)

- Behavior (start, turn, stop)

### Pillars of object-oriented programming

1. Abstraction
2. Encapsulation
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism

### Advantages

- Modularization
- Reusable

### Class

Itâ€™s a model where the **common characteristics** of a group of objects are traced.

### Instance

Element or object belonging to a class.

### Modularization

Program made up of several classes, it have many advantages, such as  being able to reuse parts of code. 

### Encapsulation

Protect the inner working of a class.

### Access methods

Connect classes of the project.
